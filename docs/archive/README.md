# Archived Documentation

This folder contains historical documentation that has been completed or superseded.

## Structure

- **completed/** - Completion reports, verification docs, fix summaries
- **testing/** - Test plans, test reports, benchmarks
- **import-rearchitecture/** - Phase plans for import system (100% complete)

## Why Archive?

These docs are kept for:
- Historical context of decisions made
- Understanding implementation approach
- Troubleshooting reference
- Learning from past work

## Need Something?

If you need to reference archived work:
1. Check the CLEANUP_LOG files for what was moved when
2. Search by filename or grep content
3. If a doc is still relevant, consider moving it back to root or implementations/
