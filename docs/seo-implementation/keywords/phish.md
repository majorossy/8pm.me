## Competitor Keyword Analysis

### What Archive.org Ranks For
- `phish live at {venue}` - Strong rankings
- `phish {date}` - Date-specific searches
- `free phish downloads` - "Free" emphasis works

**Opportunity:** Archive.org titles are too long (90+ chars) and get truncated. We can outrank with cleaner titles.

---

### What LivePhish.com Ranks For
- `buy phish shows` - Commercial intent
- `phish official releases` - Quality emphasis
- `livephish` (brand term)

**Opportunity:** LivePhish doesn't rank well for "free" searches. We can capture that traffic.

---

### What Phish.in Ranks For
- `phish {date}` - Date-specific (strong rankings)
- `phish setlist {date}` - Setlist focus
- `relisten phish` - Streaming app brand

**Opportunity:** Phish.in doesn't include venue in titles. We can outrank with venue keywords.

---
