  "biography": "The Disco Biscuits are an American jam band from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, formed in 1995 and recognized for pioneering the \"trance-fusion\" style that integrates improvisational rock jamming with electronic, trance, and psychedelic elements in extended live performances. The four original members met in the early 1990s as students at the University of Pennsylvania, initially playing covers of the Grateful Dead and Phish at fraternity parties under various names before settling on The Disco Biscuits in 1995.\n\nThe band's signature sound emerged when keyboardist Aron Magner incorporated a Roland JP-8000 synthesizer into his setup in late 1997, lending a distinctly electronic flavor to their improvisational jams. Bassist Marc Brownstein credits the improvisational ingenuity demonstrated by Phish during their 1995-97 tours as a particular inspiration. This eclectic mix of psychedelic rock, electronic music, soul, blues, jazz, and classical influences helped define their unique approach to live electronic music.\n\nBeyond their musical contributions, The Disco Biscuits are known for founding Camp Bisco in 1999, an influential multi-day music festival that grew from 800 attendees to over 10,000 by 2009. In 2004, Marc Brownstein co-founded HeadCount, a national nonpartisan nonprofit organization that registers voters at concerts and has become one of the largest voter registration organizations in the United States.\n\nThe band has created live, improvised scores to films throughout their career, including Akira (1999), Tron (2015), The Fifth Element (2023), and 2001: A Space Odyssey (2024). In 2022, they began debuting their third rock opera, Revolution in Motion, which was released in March 2024. After 20 years with drummer Allen Aucoin, the band welcomed Marlon B. Lewis on drums in October 2025.",
