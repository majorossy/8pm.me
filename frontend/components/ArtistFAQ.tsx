      answer: `EIGHTPM streams ${totalShows ? `${totalShows.toLocaleString()} ` : ''}${artistName} concert recordings for free, sourced from Archive.org. No subscription or account required. Simply browse to the ${artistName} artist page and select any show to start listening instantly.`,
    });

    // Best shows question
    faqs.push({
      question: `What are the best ${artistName} live shows to listen to?`,
      answer: `The best ${artistName} shows often feature extended improvisational jams and high-energy performances. ${mostPlayedTrack ? `"${mostPlayedTrack}" is one of the most popular tracks. ` : ''}Check the ratings and download counts on each recording - shows with higher ratings typically represent standout performances. Soundboard recordings often offer the best audio quality.`,

    // Are recordings legal
    faqs.push({
      question: `Are these ${artistName} live recordings legal to stream?`,
      answer: `Yes! All ${artistName} recordings on EIGHTPM are sourced from Archive.org, which hosts concerts with permission from artists who allow fan taping and trading. ${artistName}${genres?.includes('jam band') || genres?.includes('Jam band') ? ', like many jam bands,' : ''} encourages fans to record and share live performances as part of the taping culture.`,

    // Recording quality
    faqs.push({
      question: `What recording quality can I expect from ${artistName} shows?`,
      answer: `Recording quality varies. Soundboard (SBD) recordings offer direct mixing board captures with excellent clarity. Audience (AUD) recordings capture the venue atmosphere but may have crowd noise. Matrix recordings blend soundboard and audience sources. Each recording shows the source type so you can choose your preferred quality.`,

Their extensive touring history${totalShows ? `, documented in over ${totalShows.toLocaleString()} live recordings,` : ''} showcases their evolution as a live act.`,
